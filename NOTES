Step 1: Project Breakdown
We need to build a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with:
✅ A user interface (UI) similar to the image you shared.
✅ A scoreboard to track Player and Computer scores.
✅ A game-over condition where the game ends when a player reaches a certain score.
✅ A restart button to play again.

Step 2: Structure of the Project
We'll divide our project into three main parts:

1️⃣ HTML (Structure) – Create buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors, a scoreboard, a result display, and a restart button.
2️⃣ CSS (Styling) – Design the UI to match the image (colors, fonts, layout).
3️⃣ JavaScript (Logic & Interactivity) – Handle player choices, generate random computer choices, update the score, check for a winner, and restart the game.

Step 3: Project Plan & Workflow
We'll build the game in steps:

Set up the HTML structure (basic layout).
Style the game with CSS (to make it look nice).
Write JavaScript for game logic:
Detect player choice.
Generate computer choice.
Determine winner for each round.
Update scores.
Check if the game is over.
Display the final message and restart option.
Test & Improve
Step 4: Tools Needed
✅ Code editor – VS Code, Sublime Text, or any text editor.
✅ Browser – Chrome, Firefox, or Edge to run the game.
